		<p>Adam Elmakias is a photographer that takes photos of bands at concerts or photoshoots. He goes 
		<br>on tour with a band and takes photos of them and an other bands that are in the tour as well.</p>
		
		<h2>Interesting. Look what I found!</h2>
		
		<p>I find the photo slideshow that he has on his site interesting. Seeing 
		<br>that its on the main page of his site it gives the viewer a sample of his 
		<br>work. I've seen other sites, mostly photography sites, do this sort of 
		<br>thing as well but instead of showing one photo in the slideshow at a time 
		<br>you can see the next photo in line beside the current photo you are looking 
		<br>at. This was shown in my GD2 class and the code to do this sort of thing was 
		<br>given but not really talked about. I want to know more on how to do this instead of just copy and paste.
