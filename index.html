		<p>Alex Pardee is an artist that illustrates weird monsters and beings that are inspired by horror movies, 
			cartoons, and comics.

		<h2>Look what I found!</h2>
		
		<p>When you hover over Pardee's works the image becomes darker with a greyscale and when you click the image it
		enlarges itself and scrolls to the top of the page to allow the viewer to see the image, who it was made for,
		inspiration, materials and when it was created. Also the navigation bar stays at the top as you scroll down the page.
