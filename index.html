		<p>Adam Elmakias is a photographer that takes photos of bands at concerts or photoshoots. He goes on tour with a band and takes photos of them and an other bands that are in the tour as well.</p>
		
		<h2>Interesting. Look what I found!</h2>
		
		<p>I find the photo slideshow that he has on his site interesting. Seeing that its on the main page of his site it gives the viewer a sample of his work. I've seen other sites, mostly photography sites, do this sort of thing as well but instead of showing one photo in the slideshow at a time you can see the next photo in line beside the current photo you are looking at. This was shown in my GD2 class and the code to do this sort of thing was given but not really talked about. I want to know more on how to do this instead of just copy and paste.
