		<h3>Monday:</h3>
		<h3><a href="http://www.eyesuckink.com/">Alex Pardee</a></h3>
		<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Xl-exG9nesQ/TK7c8Fbc8kI/AAAAAAAAC18/uYi4eglZgPQ/s640/alex+pardee.jpg" alt="art">
		<p>Alex Pardee is an artist that illustrates weird monsters and beings that are inspired by horror movies, 
			cartoons, and comics.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Look what I found!</h2>
		
		<p>When you hover over Pardee's works the image becomes darker with a greyscale and when you click the image it
		enlarges itself and scrolls to the top of the page to allow the viewer to see the image, who it was made for,
		inspiration, materials and when it was created. Also the navigation bar stays at the top as you scroll down the page.
		
		<h3>Wednesday:</h3>
		<h3><a href="http://www.thirtysecondstomars.com/tour/">30 Seconds to Mars</a></h3>
		<img src="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=1315447" alt="logo">
		<p>30 seconds to mars is a band with three members and this is their official site.</p>
		
		<h2>Look What I Found!</h2>
		<p>After you enter their site the first thing you'll see is a white header with a transparent triangle––their
			symbol for the band. Behind the symbol is a image of the sky that has clouds moving.
